I could eat that girl for lunch
Yeah, she dances on my tongue
Tastes like she might be the one
And I could never get enough
I could buy her so much stuff
It's a craving, not a crush, huh
"Call me when you're there"
Said, "I bought you somethin' rare
And I left it under 'Claire'"
So now she's comin' up the stairs
So I'm pullin' up a chair
And I'm puttin' up my hair
